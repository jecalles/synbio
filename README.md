# synbio: a simple python package for doing synthetic biology
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jecalles/synbio)
This is a homebrewed package for doing synthetic biology. It provides Python classes representing common primitives in biology.

## Documentation
There is none, yet. Email me (callesjonathan@gmail.com) if you have questions

## Dependencies
Requires ![numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/). Well, only if you want to do automated gene assembly. All the core code is written in pure Python. Future refactoring will split the codebase into pure Python and external-module-dependent packages.

## Installation
Run the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jecalles/synbio.git
pip install ./synbio
```
